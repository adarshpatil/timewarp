	<p>
In lieu of my article about my lucky tryst at cracking <a href="iisc-csa-ms-interview.html">IISc CSA M.Sc(Engg) interview</a> in 2014 being helpful to a few folks preparing for admissions, I requested a good friend of mine who took up GATE in 2015 to share her experiences about the written tests and interviews during  admisssions post GATE. <br/>
My friend had greater success than me in GATE (CS Stream, Score: 765, Rank: 323) but however applied to all eligible courses in 2 institutions - IISc, Bangalore and IIT Madras. <br/>
IISc, Bangalore: SERC - MTech, M.Sc(Engg) & CSA - M.Sc(Engg) <br/>
IIT Madras: CSE - MTech, M.Sc(Engg) <br/>
<br/> </p>
<hr/>
<p>
<strong>IISc, SERC - MTech</strong> <br/> <br/>
The cut off for written round was GATE Score 750 for the CS Stream. The admission process consists of a written test and on being shortlisted, an interview. <br/>
The written round was held on 20th April and about 250-300 students attended the test. The call letter, sent about 20 days in advance, gave details about the nature of test. The test has questions on Basic Mathematics and Programming. Basic Maths includes topics from undergraduate and high school mathematics such as algebra, geometry, trigonometry, coordinate geometry, linear algebra, calculus, probability and statistics, and elementary discrete mathematics. The programming part includes topics such as basic data structures, simple concepts on algorithms, and a working knowledge of programming languages<br/>
What I found from the written test is that the tricky parts are clearing the high school math questions. It consisted of 30 MCQ questions to be answered in 60 mins. The results were announced later that evening and 75 candidates were shortlisted. I recall about half of the questions from the test. <br/>
 Here are some of the questions :<br/> 
</p>
<pre>
1.  Given 3 sides of triangle find the radius of the circumcircle
2.  Given a sphere and the triangle is drawn inside the sphere with its internal angles all right angles. Find radius of sphere
3.  A dice is tossed 5 times what is the probability that u have one odd number 
4.  Given a matrix which of the following is true?
        (a) AAt = AtA    (b) A-At /2 is skew symmetric  (c) A inverse exists     
5.  Given that multiplication and addition are the only operations how many operations are performed in a matrix multiplication 
6.  Given two sets with cardinality m and n. How many functions can be possible from m to n
7.  Consider 1/(1/(1/(1+....))) What does it evaluate to?
8.  4x3 -7x2 -4x -11. What is the min value of the function 
9.  output of a simple c program in a loop
10.  Given that a person speed is two times while walking as compared to swimming. There is a circular pool. 
       Person A wants to move from point a to point b on the diameter. 
       Which is faster swimming across or walking on perimeter or swimming half and then walking rest or 
       walking half and swimming rest
11.  Given a system or equations how many solutions exist
12.  Integral sinx /x - infinity to infinity. The integral exists only if 0 is excluded
13.  Integral x^n e-x dx. Where n>0The integral has a finite value only 
         (a) for n <= 1    (b) for n<= 2   (c) for n<=3   (d) None
14.  There is a triangular park XYZ. Given XY = XZ = 100. There is pole in the center of YZ. 
      The angle made by X,Y and Z are 45,60 and 60 respectively. What is the height of the pole. 
15.  Given a 3*3 square matrix. One of the entries is x. If the rank of the matrix should be 3 then what is the value of x.
16.  Two sinusoidal waves are graphed. The image forms an 8. Which waves are mapped?
         (a) Sin t ,cos t  (b) Cos t , sin t   (c) Sin 2t , cos t   (d) Cos 2t ,sin t

<br/><strong>IIT Madras, CSE Department - MSc(Engg)</strong> <br/> <br/>
The Computer Science and Engineering department at IIT Madras held admissions for M.Sc(Engg) on 5th May 2015. One month advance notice was given after shortlist for preparation for interview. <br/>
Some statistics from the <a href="http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/admissions/jul15-ms-criteria.php">CSE Dept</a> shows: <br/>
Total Number of Applications -	790<br/>
Number of candidates called for written test -	373<br/>
The shorlist criteria was UG percent >= 70 AND Gate Score >= 600. <br/> <br/>
On the day of the admission there were 2 papers: <br/>
First paper consisted of 30 MCQs of 1.5 hours duration. Some of the questions from the first paper are as below: <br/>
</p>
<pre>
1.  Types of functions - injective surjective and bijective -> questions based on that
2.  Aptitude question based on the dependency
3.  Question on statements and connectives which two are equivalent
4.  Code snippets and their output
5.  Question on pointers (++, & and * operator precedence)
6.  Lots of combinatoric and Probability questions
</pre>
<br/>
<p>
Second paper consisted of 15 paragraph answer questions. Any 10 questions had to be attempted. Some of the questions from the second paper were as below:
</p>
<pre>
1.  Algorithm question- k array, n elements each need to merge them into a single array with a complexity of n log k
2.  2 Questions to write DFA for a given language and prove that is the minimal DFA
3.  Question to construct Annotated Parse tree for an expression in Compiler Design
4.  Digital Design -> Construct a Mod-7 counter (with a different order) using T- flip flop
5.  Given the bytes required for each level in a network. calculate the latency on the channel
6.  Computer network question to find if a type of collision occurred or not given mode of transmission and speed of transmission
7.  Question on set associative cache mapping
8.  Given a code, find the recursive function and solve the function to find complexity
