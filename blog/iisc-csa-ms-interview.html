	<br/>
	<p>
My written test and interview was to be held on 6th June 2014 in <a href="the-longest-week.html"> "The Longest week" </a>. I had been intimated by the institute almost a month in advance (12th May) so I had ample time to prepare for the interview and test. I was also made aware in the same communication that there would be a 30 minute, 10 questions written test followed by an interview if shortlisted. <br/>
CSA department at IISc has primarily 3 specializations : <br>
&bull; Theoretical Computer :: Algorithmic Algebra, Algorithms, Data Structures and Algorithms, etc. <br/>
&bull; Computer Systems and Software :: Computer Architecture, Distributed Computing, High Performance Computing, Operating Systems,Power-Aware and Real-Time Software etc. <br/>
&bull; Intelligent Systems :: Data Mining, Machine Learning, Pattern recognition etc. <br/> <br/>

We were asked to choose one among the 3 to specialize in and the interviews / research area / guide and courses that would follow would be based on the specialization you select. Given my background at work in Operating Systems / Computer Architecture and my interest aligning to this I chose Systems specialization. I mostly spent my last few weeks before the interview reading the Design of the UNIX Operating System by Maurice Bach (I simply adore this book), Computer Organization by Hannesy and Patterson and brushing up my Math and previous GATE study subjects.<br/> <br/>

On the day I showed up at the Instutite at 9:00 AM along with a handful of 25-30 others. We faced a pretty simple straight foward written test (Seemed like a warmup). The questions if I recall were: <br/>
1. a simple C code output <br/>
2. question based on Bayes Theorem <br/>
3. question based on logical inference and set theory <br/>
4. longest path problem and it being NP Hard <br/>
5. another question in probability <br/>
6. question based on a graph theory and graph algorithm <br/> <br/>
I don't quite remember the rest at this moment of time. Anyways, we waited outside the department heart-in-mouth anxious for the results. I remember them being courteous enough to provide tea and coffee, but I was too anxious to have any. After about 25-30 mins they annouced the names of students for interview and based on specialization we were directed to different panels and almost 75% of people who attempted the test were shortlisted. I was 4th inline to be interviewed by the order they annouced. The 3 who went before me completed their interviews in about 15-20 mins. Entering the room, the panel consisted of 4 profs who were warm and welcoming and I sort of remembered their names from the faces on the site. They were <a href="http://www.csa.iisc.ernet.in/people/people-faculty-hansdah.html"> R C Hansdah </a>, <a href="http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~uday/"> Uday Reddy </a>, <a href="http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~muralikrishna/"> Murali Krishna </a> and one other prof I didn't recognize. (EDIT: The 4th prof was <a href="http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~srikant/">Y.N Srikanth</a>)<br/> <br/> 
After a brief intro into who I was, my motivation and work-ex etc, I was asked the following questions and provided a whiteboard to write and explain if needed:<br/>
--> &nbsp How do I maintain top k numbers in a sequence of n numbers? What is the complexity (Min Heap,n log k) <br/> 
--> &nbsp Given a sequence of consecutive 0's followed by 1's write an efficient program to find the location where 0 becomes 1 (I wrote my own algo that looked like a modified version of Binary search. Watch for corner cases where the algo might fail! )<br/>
--> &nbsp How do you explain mathematically big-Oh of a function and some follow up questions with examples to check if I really understand the concept <br/>
--> &nbsp Write a program for topological sort and some varitions of it later (like without destroying the adjacency list representation etc.)<br/>
--> &nbsp They asked me about my 2 favorite Math subjects - I said Linear Algebra and Set Theory. <br/>
--> &nbsp Given an integer write a C program to determine the number of 1's in its binary representation <br/>
--> &nbsp Mathematically and geometrically explain principle of Linear Independent Set of vectors, the prof continued asking me various questions on this topic to clean up my not so clear boardwork on Linear Independence. <br/> <br/>

The professors were friendly and gave hints when I was stuck on occassions. The interview lasted well over 1 hour (close to 1h 20m), and by the time I was out I was overwhelmed by the basic questions I had been asked, though on hindset they were trying to quiz me on fundamentals. I enjoyed being in that room and having that discussion with the professors that day. Most of all I enjoyed the serene lush green campus. <br/>
 A word of advice to all research IISc aspirants out there, know and revise your fundamentals however they twist it, be confident and calm, do your homework of the profs and specialization you want to align yourself with and study the background subjects needed for them. Revise and be good at ATLEAST a couple of Math core topics. <br/> <br/>
A weeks later it was the most memorable day when I was shortlisted for admission into the research program. I will be joining as a student at at CSA Dept. at IISc for MSc (Engg) Research course and looking forward to my second stint in my academic career. I am hoping for a longer stretch as I try to aim for a PhD thereafter :-)	
<br/> <br/> 
Also read the article on <a href="how-to-prepare-for-gate.html">Preparing for GATE and beyond</a>. My cliched 2 cents on this topic!
<br/><br/>
EDIT 1: Here is a <a target="_new" href="../misc/csa-research-interviews-2014.pdf">detailed doc</a> about CSA research interviews scope and process that I found to be extremely useful while preparing. It's possibly been taken off from the CSA servers but I fortunately managed to get a copy. <br/> <br/>
EDIT 2: I've got lots of questions via emails asking for selection process for M.E in CSA and SSA, MTech / M.Sc in SERC departments in IISc. So here is a quick summary for you reference. IISc publishes its GATE cut off scores for each department and corresponding GATE paper stream on the <a href="http://admissions.iisc.ernet.in/Web/SelectUGPG.aspx">admissions</a> webpage. Do refer that. <br/>
<u>M.E at CSA Department</u> <br/>
Direct admission for GATE CS paper. The cut off for GATE CS paper 1000 to 911. <br/>
<u>M.E at SSA Department</u> <br/>
Direct admission for GATE CS paper. The cut off for GATE CS paper 911 to 909. <br/>
<u>M.Tech at SERC Department</u> <br/>
There is a written round followed by a general interview. The cut off for GATE CS paper in 2014 was 700.  <br/>
<u>M.Sc(Engg) at SERC Department</u> <br/>
This process is identical to the CSA M.Sc(Engg) admission process. SERC has 2 streams <strong>(a) Computational Science</strong> and <strong> (b) Computer Systems</strong>. There is a written round followed by an interview in one of the stream chosen by you. The cut off for GATE CS paper in 2014 was 700. <br/>
The research in Computational Systems includes Bio-molecular Computation, Computational Electrodynamics, Computational Photonics, Medical Imaging, Numerical Math & Scientific Computing, Scientific Computation, Structural Biology <br/>
The research in Computer Systems includes Computer Architecture, Database Systems, Distributed Systems & Applications, High Performance Computing, Image & Video Analytics, Information Systems & Security, Middleware & Runtime Systems, and Visualization & Graphics <br/> <br/>
The good thing about IISc that I have observed over the past 1 year is that students are allowed and encouraged to take courses in other departments. So students in SERC take up courses in CSA and vice-versa to complete their course credit. Many of the faculty are joint faculty of both CSA and SERC which adds to the intertwined nature of the 2 departments. <br/> <br/>
EDIT 3: Due to the overwhelming hits this article has been getting, a good friend of mine has obliged to walk us through her <a href="post-gate-admissions-2015.html">written tests and interviews for MTech/M.Sc admission in IISc and IIT Madras in 2015</a> (GATE Rank 323, Score 765).

            <p>Hi Prashant, <br/>
				MSc(Engg) in both departments has multiple streams from which you can choose to specialize in. Both the courses are of the same duration i.e. between 2-3 years. <br/>
				In this blog above, I quickly summarized the streams offered in each dept. For clarity by streams, specifically they mean a set of topics (or research labs) that belong to the same principal area.  <br/>
				<a href="http://www.serc.iisc.in/research/research-areas/">SERC streams</a> - Computational Science & Computer Systems <br/>
				<a href="http://www.csa.iisc.ernet.in/research/research.php">CSA streams</a> - Theoretical Computer Science, Computer Systems, Intelligent Systems <br/>
				There is a requirement to complete 12 minimum course credits in both the dept. for the course. These courses can be taken from courses offered by either SERC or CSA dept. dependending on your interest. SERC takes about 10-15 students while CSA takes about 15-20 MSc students per year. As you see already see there is overlap in Computer Systems domain and hence there are joint faculty like Prof. Jayant Haritsa, Prof. R Govindarajan, Prof. Mathew Jacob in this domain between the two departments. Also there are joint profs from ML, NLP and data mining like Prof. Parth Pratim Talukdar. Apart from that the admissions to two departments are almost identical. <br/>

            <p>Thanks, Adarsh..
One more thing I want to ask.since I am more interested in the field of Computer Systems, So while applying I made SERC- Computer System as my 1st pref then CSA, will I get call from both dept or only the 1st pref? Since you mentioned some faculty is common for both the Dept. so I am assuming there will not be much diff in course structure. Still based on other aspects which dept is better? (GATE 2015 Score : 841 AIR : 116)</p>

            <p>With your GATE score you should expect/will get a call from both SERC and CSA for M.Sc(Engg) regardless of your preference in the application. However if you crack both, your preference of dept. will come into play. For systems domain, I would say that an admission in either department gives you equally excellent opportunities for research. All the best!

            <p>Hi Luvpreet, <br/>
				First congrats on getting the call - you've crossed the first hurdle. Coming to how to go about preparation, as I mentioned above there are 3 streams  in CSA for research - Computer Systems, Intelligent Systems and Theoretical Computer Science. You would have to choose one of these streams to work in. For this you can visit the <a href="http://www.csa.iisc.ernet.in/research/research.php">CSA Research page</a>. The page has links to various research labs and faculty who work in these areas (you don't have to choose a faculty/lab, just a stream. You have ample time to choose a research advisor and lab once you get an admission). Depending on your chosen area  you would be interviewed on topics relating to this field. I am assuming that you have a masters degree already since you have opted for the PhD program. Even otherwise in general for a PhD research course they look for self-motivation of the candidate to pursue research. Any paper published would be an added advantage. Also read up on all your fundamental concepts in algorithms and data structures. Mathematics is a MUST for all tests / interviews at IISc so revise all topics of engineering maths. Expect them to grill you on atleast one of the Math topics of your choice in the interview. All the best!

            <p>Hi Adarsh, <br/> <br/>
I have got a call in M.Sc for both the CSA and the SERC departments.
As per the call letters, mathematics, data structures and algorithms
are the only requirements for the entrances. Nonetheless, could you
please confirm if any other subjects' preparation is needed for the
written test and the 1st round of oral interview.<br/><br/>

Regards,<br/>

            <p>Hi Soumya, <br/>
The syllabus for CSA written round includes GATE CS syllabus for the following topics: Engineering Mathematics (all subtopics included), Programming and Data Structures, and Algorithms. The interview will be based on the research topics background subjects you choose to specialize in. Take a look at this <a href="http://www.csa.iisc.ernet.in/news/letter-interviews.pdf"> document</a> for further details. <br/>
The SERC M.Sc(Engg) written round will consist of questions from Programming in C, Data Structures, Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics, Probability and Statistics. You would find this <a href="http://www.serc.iisc.in/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SERC-CS_Research_Brochure-2015.pdf">document</a> useful for further details about  interview.<br/>
Basically the admission process is to test your fundamentals at an undergraduate level. However don't be surprised if you get an application question based on above topics into other topics. All the best!

            <p> M.Sc(Engg) is a master by research program with an average duration of 2.5 years for completion. You would be required to publish atleast one research papers  (in some cases 2 papers) in tier 1 conferences and conclude the course with a thesis, colloquium and defense similar to a (half) PhD. <br/><br/>

M.Sc (Engg) gives you equal opportunities for campus placement as your fellow ME / MTech counterparts. You have a choice to sit for placements ONCE either in 2nd year or 3rd year depending on your progress of research. If the companies are willing you can sit for placement in the 2nd year and complete your thesis / research work and join slightly late. IISc not only gets 100% placements but also provides opportunities to choose from ample number of Tier1 companies, with profiles ranging from R&D to core development teams. However in M.Sc (Engg) since you would have worked within a single domain as your core research area you would more likely be targeting companies (and vice versa) which are closest to your field of work rather than writing any and every company during placements.<br/>
If you would like to convert to a PhD at IISc you can do so by simply giving a letter to your research advisor anytime during your first year. If you would like to continue with PhD course after M.Sc(Engg) you can do so by submitting a letter to this effect withing 15 days of submitting your thesis.
IISc also has a very good name for producing quality research and many students who want to purse PhD in other aboard universities have been extended offers during the conferences they attend when they publish papers and journals.<br/>

            <p>Fresh out of college am not sure if I am fit for a research course like MS. What made you decide for taking MS course over MTech. What are the career prospects after MS?

            <p>First let me give you some statistics. The current batch of M.Sc (Engg) at CSA has about 40% students who have some work experience and rest are fresh out of college like you. There is a good mix of people with work experience and fresh college graduates in the senior years as well. If you show enough potential and background knowledge in your chosen field there is no doubt that you can make it as well.<br/>

Since M.Sc(Engg) is a masters by research course and you would be required to read, understand and explore your field of interest by yourself. You would be guided by your research adviser all through and the courses you take will help facilitate that line of thinking to a certain extent, specially in IISc where the focus is on research. Most of all you need to be self motivated and have a passion to explore as you would be under no obligation or in direct competition with people around you. Your field of research is your own and what you work on will most likely be understood by a select few. You can still bounce ideas of other areas. <br/>

Personally my 2 cents is that I have learnt quite a bit in my short 2 year career at the industry but given today's resources you could pick up those skills while in bachelors as well.<br/>

As for career prospects, please refer to my reply in the comment earlier. <br/>
The placements scenario is similar in IITs as well where the companies are open to both ME and M.Sc(Engg). <br/>

            <p>Depends on what you mean by aptitute. Some of the basic mathematics questions about the circle can be called an aptitute questions. Also, There were totally 30 questions. These are a sample of some questions that appeared in the test. </p>

            <p>Hi I got call from Research Program IISc SERC CS Stream. I am a graduate and will be taking MSc program (not PhD).In the interview brochure, it has been specified that there will be a written test followed by first interview on Basic Area Subjects which are
Programming in C, Algorithms and Data structures. Then there will be interview on Advanced Subjects corresponding to the area chosen. I
want to know how much emphasis is put on the Advanced Subjects. Since some of the advanced subject listed are Natural Language Processing,
Machine Learning which I never had in my syllabus. <br/><br/>
Also CSA sub areas include Combinatorial geometry, computational gepmetry, game theory...which am unaware of

            <p>For advanced area subjects in the oral interview of SERC you are expected to have some background in atleast one subject   pertaining to the lab you are aspiring to work in. This is done to make sure that the candidate is aware of the area he is getting into, you are not expected to show zen level skills in it. Even simple BE/BTech projects will help to get some background. However, make sure you nail the basic area subject questions.<br/>
In CSA, the sub areas you mentioned "Combinatorial geometry, computational gepmetry, game theory" are not the topics that will be tested. Those are research areas you can work in if you get selected. The background subjects (refer table 1 in CSA brochure) for these topics is what you will tested on in the interview. Once you choose an area of interest from column 2, you should prepare the corresponding background subjects for the interview.

            <p>I don't know a whole lot about the CeNSE department at IISc but usually the norm for any grad course in IISc the mathematicsk knowledge expected is fundamental Maths and Engg. Maths (All that you studied for GATE). There's not a whole lot they ask outside of that and there is nothing to be afraid of it either. What I would say is - expect to be questioned in Maths, so prepare these topics. Here are 2 questions from Quora that may help you: <br/>

            <p>Aman - Congrats on making it. Usually offer letters are sent out to all of the short listed candidates. It's just an administrative formality where the admission department verifies your application, number of seats, hostel capacity etc. The offer letters are usually sent immediately following the announcement of the shortlist. You should be receiving the offer letters sometime this week.

            <p>Hi Adarsh, I was shortlisted by the CSA department but the final list prepared by the Admissions department doesn't reflect the same. Little confused on what went wrong. I chose Machine Learning and NLP as the choices. Is there a wait list system that they maintain. Please let me know if you have any information.</p>

            <p>Aman - I am not aware or have visibility into a final list being prepared by the Admissions department. The usual course is that once you are shortlisted in CSA, within a few days you get an email from the Academic Registrar with your offer letter and further admission instructions. If you've not recieved the email yet I would suggest waiting for a day or two and then dropping an email to ar@academic.admin.iisc.ernet.in asking for the status. A few of my friends who were shortlisted at CSA have started receiving offer letters starting Monday evening. I can only speculate that they would be send out in batches but I am not the authoritative source for it. </p>

            <p>Hi, <br/>
<br/>
I am short-listed by CSA for research program. I haven't got the offer letter yet. when I contacted, they told me that i am in waiting list. <br/>
Perhaps 14 people are there who haven't got offer letter yet, while other have been called for admission. <br/>
so my question is, what are chances for wait-listed candidate to get offer letter?? <br/>
can you let me know about research program intake for 2015. <br/>
<br/>
@aman......did you get offer letter now or you have the same condition??</p>

            <p>@krishn @aman: I donot have visibility into the waitlist. However, I can give you are some statistics about number of seats available from past years at CSA Department (these numbers are including ERP, defence and TEQIP quota candidates) <br/>
            2014 research admissions : 17 M.Sc(Engg) and 10 PhD students <br/>
            2013 research admissions : 11 M.Sc(Engg) and 11 PhD students <br/>
            I believe you will get an offer, if someone drops out from the list of candidates who have currently been extended offers. I can also tell you that the last date for confirming / rejecting the seat for the offered students and paying fees is July 3, 2015. You should wait untill that date. All the best!

            <p>As I said earlier, I doubt that information about merit list / waiting list status is available publically. The only way to know your admission status is by sending an email to the academic registrar. Tagging @krishn and @aman to answer your above query and update you if they have further information.</p>
